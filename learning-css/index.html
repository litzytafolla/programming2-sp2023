	<h1>At Home Nail Care</h1>
	<p>Simple nail polish is oftentimes the first experience to at home nails. You paint them, wait for them to air dry, and proceed to the next step. This takes a lot of time.</p>
	<p>Gel nail polish is the next step in at home nails. In a salon, they'd be much more expensive than done at home.</p>
