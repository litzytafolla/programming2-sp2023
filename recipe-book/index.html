		Gluten-free alternatives can be hard to find in stores, and oftentimes it's up to us to cook in the kitchen. Below are a few recipes that will, hopefully, keep you healthy and ready the entire day.

	<p class="text_style">
	Its important to start your day with a healthy breakfast. If you eat gluten-free then the start of your day might consist of bland crumbly bread, yogurt, and rice cakes. But your day should not start like that! Even GF alternatives can fuel your body, while tasting delicious and giving the joy that their gluten counterparts give. This delicious GF quiche recipe is filling and <b>very</b> tasty.

	<p class="text_style">
	<i>All</i> seafoods are my absolute favorite. Luckily, they typically do not have gluten, but when I crave crab cakes I have to make due with the pain my stomach will be in after. These GF crab cakes are absolutely amazing. No pain, so good, and super easy to make.

	<a href="GFPumpkinroll.html" class="linked_recipe_style">Gluten-Free Pumpkin rolls</a>
	<p class="text_style">

	Pastries and baked goods are soooo delicious. But oftentimes these cupcakes, muffins, and cookies have tons of gluten (to help the bread rise of course). These GF Pumpkin rolls are <i>sublime</i>, GF, and encompass lovely fall days and orange leaves. I'm getting ahead of myself now, but really. These pumpkin rolls are full of nostalgia, <b>without</b> the gluten. ðŸ˜‰
